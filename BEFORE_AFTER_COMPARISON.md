# 🔍 BEFORE vs AFTER: Visual Comparison

## ❌ BEFORE (Broken)

### Error You Were Getting:
```
[21:32:13] Step 1: Buying PLS on pulsex_v1...
[21:32:14] ❌ Trade failed: Buy failed: SwapExecutor.execute_swap() 
            got an unexpected keyword argument 'amount_out_min'
```

### The Broken Code (main_v7.py, line 317-324):
```python
result = self.backend.swap_executor.execute_swap(
    dex=dex,
    token_in=token_in,
    token_out=token_out,
    amount_in=amount_in_wei,
    amount_out_min=amount_out_min,        # ❌ WRONG PARAMETER NAME
    private_key=self.backend.wallet_manager.private_key  # ❌ UNNECESSARY
)
```

### Why It Failed:
```
main_v7.py calls:         amount_out_min=...
                                   ↓
                          ❌ MISMATCH!
                                   ↓
swap_executor_v4.py expects:   min_amount_out=...
```

## ✅ AFTER (Fixed)

### What You'll See Now:
```
[21:32:13] Step 1: Buying PLS on pulsex_v1...

```

### The Fixed Code (main_v7.py, line 307-315):
```python
result = self.backend.swap_executor.execute_swap(
    dex=dex,
    token_in=token_in,
    token_out=token_out,
    amount_in=amount_in_wei,
    min_amount_out=amount_out_min    # ✅ CORRECT PARAMETER NAME
    # private_key removed - swap_executor already has it!
)
```

### Why It Works Now:
```
main_v7.py calls:         min_amount_out=...
                                   ↓
                          ✅ PERFECT MATCH!
                                   ↓
